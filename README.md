# Nodejs Chat App

A simple nodejs chat application using web sockets.

## WebSockets and socket.io

WebSockets is a protocol that allows a bilateral synchronous exchange between a client and a server.
In the classic web, a client requests to a server and a server responds sending it back the data. This system is impossible for a chat app.
In WebSockets, the server can send data to the client, but the client can too ! A WebSocket is a kind of communication pipe opened in two directions.
Socket.io is a library based on this protocol to make the use of WebSockets easier.
